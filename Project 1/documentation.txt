Documentation for project 1 - Aim Lab

I used the RandomWalker randomness concept to come up with the idea of Aim lab. When i play competitve fps games, i find that if there was 
a browser based aim practice arena, it would be so cool to just practice and it would help me in the game. It used Javascript and canvas feature of HTML.

Minimal CSS is used. It is not mobile friendly yet.

So this aim lab is the solution for that-

It incorporates the difficulty you wanna play target practice. You can change your fps depending on your monitor(if it supports more than 60fps, choose 120fps)
Easy is 4 seconds, Normal is 2, Hard is 1 and impossible is 0.2 seconds which is just for fun. You can also select the sound of the gun you want to shoot.
Its between 4 pistols found in valorant: Sheriff, classic, shorty and Ghost.

There is also a reset button in case someone rages and wants to start over.
